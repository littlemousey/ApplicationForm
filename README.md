# ApplicationForm
Application form connected to Google sheets and Dropbox

The example form is in Dutch but the overall idea is to send form data to Google Sheets and a pdf or document to a certain Dropbox folder. The code is built based on the tutorials of Jamie Wilson (https://github.com/jamiewilson/form-to-google-sheets) and Dropbox for Javascript docs (https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-js).

To prepare the Google Sheet follow the first 5 steps of https://github.com/jamiewilson/form-to-google-sheets

The UI is in Material Design.
